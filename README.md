# Face Recognition Data Cleaning with XAI

This repository contains the implementation of our research paper titled:

**Implementing Explainable AI in Dataset Cleaning
for Face Recognition Models**

## Overview

This project focuses on improving face recognition systems through a combination of:
- **Data Cleaning Techniques:** Using Isolation Forest, adaptive label noise cancellation, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Local Outlier Factor (LOF) for outlier detection and anomaly removal.
- **Explainable AI (XAI) Methods:** Employing SHAP, LIME, and Class Activation Maps (CAM) for interpretability and validation of model predictions.

The repository includes:
- Code for implementing data cleaning techniques
- Training and evaluation scripts for face recognition models
- Integration of XAI tools for model interpretation
